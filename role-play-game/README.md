## Overview

### The challenge

In this practice project, I'd learned fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game learning how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project doesn't have a lot of chagens about the original code and my own code. There is just some updates to ES6 syntax. So, I go to the explanation now.

#### Main Variables

There is some variables to know before start the project. These wil be helpful in the future.

```javascript
let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;
let fighting;
let monsterHealth;  
let inventory = ["stick"];

const button1 = document.querySelector('#button1');
const button2 = document.querySelector("#button2");
const button3 = document.querySelector("#button3");
const text = document.querySelector("#text");
const xpText = document.querySelector("#xpText");
const healthText = document.querySelector("#healthText");
const goldText = document.querySelector("#goldText");
const monsterStats = document.querySelector("#monsterStats");
const monsterName = document.querySelector("#monsterName");
const monsterHealthText = document.querySelector("#monsterHealth");
```

- `let xp`: This always starts at 0 and will be added according to the logic implemented;
- ``let currentWeapo``: This is the control to use in inventory;
- ``let fighting``: This will be used to calculate some features like the damage, xp and etc...
- ``let inventory``: The inventory always will starts with "***stick***" weapon because it is the weakest weapon in this game;

The variables doens't needs explanations because they are just elements in HTML

#### The logic of code

The first thing that we come across is threes arrays of objects. The first one has the ``weapons`` data. Each index contains the an objects that have a ``name`` and ``power`` keys. The ``power`` will be used to calculate the damage in the code.

```javascript
const weapons = [
  { name: 'stick', power: 5 },
  { name: 'dagger', power: 30 },
  { name: 'claw hammer', power: 50 },
  { name: 'sword', power: 100 }
];
```

The second array of objects is the ``monsters`` array's. This contains ``name``, ``level`` and ``health`` of monster. 

```javascript
const monsters = [
  {
    name: "slime",
    level: 2,
    health: 15
  },
  {
    name: "fanged beast",
    level: 8,
    health: 60
  },
  {
    name: "dragon",
    level: 20,
    health: 300
  }
]
```

The last one array is an object.``locations``. This contains ``name``, ``button text`` array that has the text of each location that will appear as ``textContent`` when ``update()`` is called, ``buttons functions`` that is another array with ***reference*** of function that will used in ``update()`` and the last key is ``text`` that will appear when ``update()`` is called.

#### Explaining functions

At this point, we come across with a few functions. So as not to make it too long, I will talk about it three at time. The firsts ones are ``update()``, ``goTown()``, ``goStore()`` and ``goCave()`` functions.

  ##### ``update()``
  
  ```javascript
  const update = (location) => {
  monsterStats.style.display = "none";
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
  text.innerHTML = location.text;
}
  ```
This function takes a parameter called "location" that is an array of objects. In this function, the first thing that happens is set ``monsterStats.style.display`` to ``none``. This makes the container dissapear. Then, we set the buttons ``innerText`` to the respective ``location[Â´"button text"][index]``. Now, we used almost same syntax to assing the reference of functions to the ``buttons.onclick``, finally assing the ``text.innerHTML`` to the ``location.text``. This will take any place in the game and render the correct informations about it.
